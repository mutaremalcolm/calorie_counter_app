### ðŸ‘‹ Introduction:

---

I developed the Calorie Counter application to empower individuals seeking better control over their dietary habits and to support them in achieving their fitness goals. The application simplifies the process of tracking calorie intake and calculating the precise portions needed to meet specific weight objectives. In addition, it offers supplementary tools such as a BMI calculator and a Macro-Nutrient calculator to provide more comprehensive health insights.

For the tech stack, I chose Vite for its fast build times, NextAuth for seamless authentication, Firebase for reliable data persistence, and ZOD for robust validation.
<br/>

## Features

- **BMR & TDEE Calculation:** The app uses the Harris-Benedict formula to calculate Basal Metabolic Rate (BMR) and Total Daily Energy Expenditure (TDEE).
- **Weight Goal Estimates:** Provides estimates for calorie intake required to maintain, lose, or gain weight.
- **Activity Levels:** Users can choose from various activity levels (sedentary, lightly active, moderately active, very active).
- **BMI Calculator:** A built-in BMI calculator to assess whether users are underweight, normal, or overweight.
- **Ideal Weight Calculator:** Suggests an ideal weight based on user height and other factors.
- **Responsive Design:** Fully responsive across all screen sizes (mobile, tablet, desktop).
<br/>

## Technologies

This app uses the following technologies:

- **React:** JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- **TypeScript:** Type-safe JavaScript for scalability and better development experience.
- **Tailwind CSS:** A utility-first CSS framework for rapid UI development.
- **Vite:** Next-generation build tool that is fast and modern.
- **Firebase Auth:** For handling user authentication and access.
- **Shadcn UI:** For creating accessible, customizable components.
- **LocalStorage API:** To store theme preferences (light/dark mode).
- **React Router:** For handling in-app navigation.
