            1990 by the more accurate Mifflin-St Jeor Equation. The
            Katch-McArdle Formula differs by factoring in lean body mass, making
            it more precise for lean individuals who know their body fat
            percentage. Of these, the Mifflin-St Jeor is generally considered
            the most accurate for calculating BMR, except when lean body mass is
            accounted for using the Katch-McArdle Formula.`,
